/*
 * GBA-address shadow of the engine's native state.
 *
 * This is a decompilation port, not an emulator: there is no live GBA memory
 * image. The engine's state lives in native C globals (`SaveFile gSave;` and
 * friends), so reading 0x02002A40 out of gEwram returns nothing.
 *
 * RetroAchievements sets for AGB are authored against a real GBA dump and
 * RA's GBA memory map is flat (0x000000-0x007FFF -> 0x03000000 IWRAM,
 * 0x008000-0x047FFF -> 0x02000000 EWRAM). So achievement conditions have to
 * be served from a shadow buffer built out of the native globals, placed at
 * the GBA addresses recorded in linker.ld. That is what makes a condition
 * like "0x02002A90 & 0x04" evaluate correctly against a native port.
 *
 * Only byte ranges whose native layout is provably identical to retail are
 * shadowed; see the table and the rejected list in port_gba_shadow.c.
 * Everything else is not served: reads there return 0 bytes, which rcheevos
 * treats as an unsupported address rather than evaluating against zero.
