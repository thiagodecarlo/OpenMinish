/*
 * port/rando/rando_entrance.h — coupled dungeon-entrance shuffle (runtime).
 *
 * The GBA randomizer's "Dungeon Entrance Shuffle" patches ROM transition structs so
 * that each of the 8 shuffleable entrance doors leads to its assigned dungeon
 * and every way OUT of that dungeon (door exit, post-boss green warp,
 * element-get warp, Palace ledge hole) returns to the door it was entered
 * through. The native port performs the same remap at runtime instead of
 * patching data: the engine's transition choke points call these hooks after
 * filling gRoomTransition.player_status and the destination is rewritten in
 * place when (and only when) an active seed carries entrance assignments.
 *
 * No-op when the seed is inactive or no `Items.Entrance.*` assignment exists
 * (vanilla seeds / logic without entrance shuffle).
